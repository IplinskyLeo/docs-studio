Anypoint Studio uses your system's default layout engine to render the Anypoint Platform UI.

If you are experiencing issues visualizing web content such as the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform, or Exchange when browsing assets for your project, configure Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as its underlying renderer for the Web UI.
