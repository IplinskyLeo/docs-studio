. Add your `.cer` file certificate to your Studio embedded Java cacerts keystore:
+
[source]
--
Bin\keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore [cacerts_path] \ //<1>
- storepass [pass] \ //<2>
- alias [alias] \ //<3>
-import -file [certificate_name].cer //<4>
--
+
<1> `cacerts_path` is your Anypoint Studio artifact. +
For example: `AnypointStudio.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.mule.tooling.jdk.macosx.x86_64_1.0.0.202002191445/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts`
<1> `pass` is your certificate's password. +
If you don't provide a password for this certificate, the keytool generates the password `changeit` by default.
<1> `alias` is the name you give to your certificate
<1> `certificate name` is the path to the generated .pem file you saved in the previous step.
. In Studio, open the preferences view. +
Navigate to *Window* > *Preferences...*.
. Type the URL of your PCE installation in the *Private Cloud Instance URL* field.
+
