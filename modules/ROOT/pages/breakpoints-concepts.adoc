You can add breakpoints to your message processors so that Mule stops the execution of your flow at that particular so that you can inspect the content of the message as it exists at that point in the flow,

When you set a breakpoint, Studio activates the breakpoint by default. The Mule Breakpoints View indicates the activation with a checked box to the left of the breakpoint name. Uncheck the box to deactivate a breakpoint.

Though deactivated, Studio does not delete the breakpoint. In the canvas, the breakpoint's corresponding event processor displays a gray circle instead of red.

Additionally you can activate the *Mute Breakpoints* option in the Mule Debugger View, to temporarily disallow the debugger to stop at your selected breakpoints.

A default breakpoint stops the execution of the flow when the message reaches it. You can also configure a breakpoint to execute when a specific condition in the message is met, or whenever an error occurs. See the types of breakpoints below for more details.

== Default Breakpoint

Default configuration for a user-defined breakpoint. The breakpoint is set on a user-defined event processor, and activated by default. When a message reaches the breakpoint, Studio stops flow execution and displays the contents of the message in the Mule Debugger View.

=== Set a Default Breakpoint

To set a default breakpoints, right-click a message processor and select *Add Breakpoint*.

When you run your application in Debug mode, Studio stops the flow execution at the breakpoint you set, allowing you to inspect the message's content in the Mule Debugger View.

== Conditional Breakpoint

A conditional breakpoint activates when a predefined condition evaluates to true when Studio executes the Event Processor with the breakpoint. You define the condition using a DataWeave expression.

=== Set a Conditional Breakpoint

To set a conditional breakpoint:

. Right-click the message processor and select *Add Breakpoint*.
. Click the breakpoint in the Mule Breakpoints View to select it.
. Check *Conditional* at the bottom of the Mule Breakpoints View.
. Enter the condition that must be met for the breakpoint to be activated.

For example, the following expression activates the breakpoint if the method used in the request is GET:

[source]
----
attributes.method == "GET"
----

You don't need to stop the application's execution to change the condition.

== Error Breakpoint

This is a global parameter. When set, Studio stops flow execution at any event processor where an exception occurs. The Mule Debugger View will display the message contents at the event processor that threw the exception.

=== Set Error Breakpoints

To stop the execution of the flow whenever an error occurs select the *Enable error breakpoints*  button (image:to-set-error-breakpoints-55f71.png[error-breakpoint-icon]) in the Mule Breakpoints view.

This parameter causes any Event Processor in the application to become a breakpoint if it throws an error. Studio stops flow execution at the event processor which threw the error, then displays the message in the Mule Debugger View.

Additionally, Studio identifies the error with a red, dotted-line square in the processor that failed during execution.
