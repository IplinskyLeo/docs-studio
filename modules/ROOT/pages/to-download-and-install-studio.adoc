To download and install Anypoint Studio, follow the instructions based on your operating system:

* xref:to-download-and-install-studio-wx.adoc[Windows]
* xref:to-download-and-install-studio-ox.adoc[MacOS]
* xref:to-download-and-install-studio-lx.adoc[Linux]

Anypoint Studio 7.x only supports Mule 4.x projects since the structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different.
