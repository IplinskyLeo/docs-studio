When necessary you can update the API specification in your Studio project.

To update the API specification:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click the Mule project that contains the API specification you want to update.
. Select *API Specs* > the name of your API > *Update Version*.

After you update the version, Studio asks you if you want to regenerate the flows based on the new version.

Additionally, you can manage the API specifications in your project that are linked to Exchange from the API specification project management view. To do so, click the *Manage Mule Project APIs* icon (image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%]) in the top task bar.
