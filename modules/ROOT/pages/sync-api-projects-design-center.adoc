= Synchronize API Specifications with Design Center

Anypoint Studio 7.5 and later enables you to import a RAML or OAS API specification from Design Center into an API Project in Studio to edit it offline, and stage and push your changes as you would do with any version control system (VCS).

This feature only works when importing an API from Design Center as shown in the following process. +
To import an API specification to write a Mule application implementation see xref:import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[Import an API Specification From Design Center].

Studio uses the EGit plugin only for the VCS feature of editing API specifications offline. Studio does not support the EGit plugin for Mule application projects that you might track using your own VCS.

== Import an API Specification From Design Center To Edit Locally

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *Import*.
. Select *Anypoint Studio* > *API Specification from Design Center*.
. In the *Import From Design Center* window, select your Anypoint Platform username and the Anypoint Platform business group where the API specification is located.
+

+
If you are not logged in, click the *Add Account* button to add your Anypoint Platform account. If you have not configured your Anypoint Platform credentials, the username and business group options are unavailable. +
If you want to use a different account, click the *Add Account* button and log in again.
. From the list of available APIs, select the one you want.
+
image::list-of-apis-studio.png[]
. Click *Finish*.

Studio imports the API specification as an API project so that you can work on your API project offline.

== Create Branches

You can create your own branch based on the branch you pulled from Design Center. +
Using a different branch allows you to modify the API definition without risking pushing those changes to the main branch in Design Center.

To create a different branch in Studio:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click your API project and select *Team* > *Switch To* > *New Branch...*.
+
image::switch-to-new-branch.png[]
. In the *Create Branch* window, configure your new branch:
+
image::create-new-branch.png[]
<1> In the *branch name* field, type the name of your new branch.
<1> You can select the *Configure upstream for push and pull* option if you want to also pull changes from Design Center into your local branch. +
When configuring this option, you must select the behavior you want git to have when it pulls the changes from Design Center.
<1> Select the *Check out new branch* for git to switch to this new branch as soon as you create it.
. Select *Finish*.

With a newly created branch, you can start committing your changes.

[[commit-to-branch]]
== Commit Changes to Your API Project

The VCS in Studio tracks every change you make to your project and shows them in the *Unstaged Changes* area of your *Git Staging* view.

You can track your changes to a file by right-clicking it in the *Unstaged Changes* section and select *Compare with index*:

image::compare-with-index.png[]

After applying your changes, add them to your index:

image::compare-to-index-view.png[]

<1> Use the *Add selected files to the index* icon to stage for commit the files that you selected.
<1> Use the *Add all files including not selected ones to the index* icon to stage for commit all unstaged changes.

When you staged the changes that you want to commit, write a commit message in the *Commit Message* section:

image::add-commit-message.png[]

<1> Select *Commit and Push* to also push the change to Design Center. +
See <<push-branch,Push Your Branch to Design Center>> below for more information.
<1> Select *Commit* to add the commit to your local copy.

See xref:git-staging-view-reference.adoc[Git Staging View Reference] for more information about this view.

== Merge Your Changes into the Master Branch

You can merge the changes made in your local branch to the master branch to push to Design Center:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click your API project and select *Team* > *Merge* > *Push Branch...*.
+
image::merge-menu.png[]
. Select the local branch to which you want to merge your changes:
+
image::merge-view.png[]
. Select *Merge*.


[[push-branch]]
== Push Your Branch to Design Center

You can choose to publish your local branch to Design Center after you committed all your changes to your local branch:

. In the Package Explorer view, right-click your API project and select *Team* > *Switch To* > *Push Branch...*.
+
image::push-branch.png[]
. Verify the changes that you are pushing to Design Center.
+
image::push-branch-view.png[]
<1> The *Source* section shows the changes that you are pushing to Design Center.
<1> The *Remote* section shows the coordinates to the remote you are pushing to.
<1> The *Branch* section shows the local branch that you are pushing.
<1> You can select the *Configure upstream for push and pull* option if you want to also pull changes from Design Center into your local branch. +
When configuring this option, you must select the behavior you want git to have when it pulls the changes from Design Center.
<1> Select the *Force overwrite branch in remote if it exists and has diverged* only if you know that your local changes must overwrite the changes in Design Center. +
This option force pushes your changes to the branch in Design Center.
. Select *Preview* to see a summary of the changes you are pushing.
. Select *Push*

In certain scenarios, someone else might have modified the version in Design Center while you modified the same version locally. This triggers conflicts in git. +
