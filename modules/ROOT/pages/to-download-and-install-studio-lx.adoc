== Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the Java SE JDK 8 installed and configured.
* To support the Studio Theme in Linux, have GTK version 2 installed.
* Download the Anypoint Studio installation file from the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio/previous[Download Site].

== Installation

. Open the extracted Anypoint Studio.
. Click *OK* to accept the default workspace.
** You must Use an absolute path when defining your workspace because Anypoint Studio does not expand the `~` tilde used in Unix and Linux systems.

== Troubleshooting

If Anypoint Studio fails to load with a *An Error Has Occurred* message, you must configure it to point to your JDK installation as the default VM:

. Locate your `AnypointStudio.ini` file in `/usr/lib/anypointstudio/anypointstudio.ini`.
. Add the `-vm` option to point to your specific JDK installation path.

* The `-vm` option and the installation path must be on separate lines.
* The value must be the full absolute or relative path to the Java executable, not just to the Java home directory.
* The `-vm` option must occur after the other Studio-specific options (such as `-product`, `--launcher.*`, etc), but before the `-vmargs` option.
