= DataWeave Expression Watches

When debugging your Mule application, you may need to watch for a specific expression while the executions is paused. You can enter a DataWeave expression to watch  as your application is being executed. When the debugger reaches a breakpoint, it will save the expression and display it as you step through your code.

For example, you can set two expressions:

* One expression to evaluate whether the method for a request is "GET":
+
[source]
--
attributes.method == "GET"
--
* And another expression to inspect the payload of the message:
+
[source]
--
payload
--

When you run the application in debug mode and the debugger stops at a breakpoint, the debugger view will display whether the request watch returned either `true` or `false`, and the value of the payload for the payload watch.


== Evaluate a DataWeave Expression

. Ensure that Studio has stopped the flow execution at the desired breakpoint. When stopped, the breakpoint appears surrounded by a dotted blue line in the canvas, and Studio populates the Mule Debugger View with information.
. Click the DataWeave Expression Watches icon
 image:to-evaluate-breakpoint-using-expression-336e3.png[] above the right-hand pane in the Mule Debugger View. Studio displays the expression evaluation window.
. Type the DataWeave expression you wish to evaluate in the provided input field, and press enter. Studio evaluates the expression, then displays the result in the Name, Value and Type columns.

Using the expression evaluation window, you can also edit message properties or attributes. Right-click the property value or attribute, type the new value, and press enter.

== Add a DataWeave Expression Watch

To instruct Studio Debugger to watch for an expression:

. In  your Expression Watches View, click the Add Expression image:mule-watches-view-reference-fcc2a.png[add-icon] icon.
. The debugger prompts you to enter the new expression for which to watch.
. Studio displays the new Watch in the Mule Expression Watches View. +
If your expression is a declaration, the debugger returns a boolean; if not, returns the value. For example:
+
* The expression `message.payload == 'myPayload'` returns either `true` or `false`.
* The expression `message.payload` returns the value of `message.payload`.
