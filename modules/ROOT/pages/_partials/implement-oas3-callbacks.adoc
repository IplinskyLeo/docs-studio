= Implement OAS 3 Callbacks

Callbacks from an OAS 3 API specification cannot be automatically implemented into a Mule application in Studio or using APIkit.

If your OAS 3 API specification uses callbacks, you must manually implement them into your flow as shown in the following example:

. Assume a `/subscribe` resource in an OAS 3 specification that uses a `callbackUrl` property:

paths:
  /subscribe:
    post:
      summary: Subscribe to a webhook
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                callbackUrl:   # Callback URL
                  type: string
                  format: uri
                  example: https://myserver.com/send/callback/here
              required:
                - callbackUrl
--
. When importing this API specification, Studio creates an empty flow for the `/subscribe` resource.

. Create an object store to store the callback URL mentioned in the callback section: `'{$request.body#/callbackUrl}'` to `#[payload.callbackUrl]`.
. Set a new variable in the flow to set a `statusCode` to 201.
