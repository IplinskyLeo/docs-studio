= Propagate Metadata to Other Flows

Studio enables you to propagate your flow's metadata to other flows referenced within your application.

Depending on the metadata configured in your referenced flow, you might need to configure the specific metadata to propagate.

== Propagate Metadata to a Flow Without Custom Metadata

When you add a Flow Reference component and reference another flow with no custom metadata configured, Studio automatically propagates the metadata in your flow as custom metadata in your target flow.

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for this project, and select *Finish*.
. Drag two flow components to your empty canvas and name them `flow-1` and `flow-2` respectively.

. In `flow-1`, drag a Set Payload component and configure the payload as:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+

. Drag a Logger component to `flow-2`, and configure it to log the `payload`.
+
image::logger-payload-metadata.png[]
. Drag a Flow Reference component to the end of `flow-1`, and configure it to reference _flow-2_:
+
image::flow-reference-metadata.png[]
. Note that the metadata tab in `flow-2` is now populated with autogenerated metadata, and the input tab in the metadata explorer reflects the payload format that the Set Payload component determines in `flow-1`.

== Propagate Metadata When Extracting an Operation From Your flow to a New Flow.

When you extract an operation from your flow to a new flow or sub-flow, Studio enables you to configure the metadata that you want to propagate to the newly created flow:

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for this project, and select *Finish*.
. Drag a flow component to your empty canvas and name it `flow-1`.
. Drag a Set Payload component and configure the payload as:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+
image::set-payload-flow-1.png[]
. Drag a Logger component to the end of `flow-1`, and configure it to log `#[payload.value.departureDate]`.
+
image::logger-metadata-case-2.png[]
. Right-click your Logger component and select *Extract To...* > *Flow*.
+
image::extract-operation-metadata.png[]
. Name your target flow `flow-2`.
. Select *Metadata Preferences* to configure the input and output metadata. +
Note that Studio automatically recognizes the metadata of your flow.
+
image::extract-flow-metadata.png[]
. Select *OK*.
. Your Logger component is now in `flow-2`, the metadata tab is populated with autogenerated metadata, and the input tab in the metadata explorer reflects the payload format that the Set Payload component configures in `flow-1`.

== Propagate Metadata to a Flow With Custom Metadata Already Configured

When you add a Flow Reference component and reference another flow that has custom metadata already configured, Studio prompts you to select the metadata that you want to propagate.

. In the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for this project, and select *Finish*.
. Drag two flow components to your empty canvas and name them `flow-1` and `flow-2` respectively.
+
image::both-flows-metadata.png[]
. In `flow-1`, drag a Set Payload component and configure the payload as:
+
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "departureDate": "2016/12/20",
    "emptySeats": 200,
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
+
image::set-payload-config.png[]
. Create a JSON file with the name _arrival-type-example.json_ in your `src/main/resources/examples` directory with the following format:
+
.arrival-type-example.json
[source,JSON,linenums]
--
{
  "value": {
    "ID": 1,
    "arrivalDate": "2016/12/20",
    "plane": {
      "type": "Boeing 747",
      "totalSeats": 400
    }
  }
}
--
. Select `flow-2` in your canvas, select the *Metadata* tab, and *Add Metadata*:
+
image::add-metadata-flow-2.png[]
. Select *Input: Payload*, and then select the *Edit*.
+
image::configure-input-metadata.png[]
.  Select *Add*, create a new metadata type called _arrivalType_, and select *Create type*.
+
image::create-metadata-type.png[]
. Select the type *JSON* > *Example* and select the *...* button to browse to `src/main/resources/examples/arrival-type-example.json`
+
image::create-json-metadata-type.png[]
. Click *Select*.
. Drag a Logger component to `flow-2`, and configure it to log the `payload`.
+
image::logger-payload-metadata.png[]
. Drag a Flow Reference component to the end of `flow-1`, and configure it to reference _flow-2_:
+
image::flow-reference-metadata.png[]
. Select the Flow Reference component *Metadata* tab, and select *Set Metadata*.
+
image::set-metadata-example.png[]
+
Studio warns you that setting the metadata from `flow-1` will overwrite the existing `arrivalType` metadata type configured for `flow-2`.
+
image::overwrite-metadata.png[]
. Select *Customize* to configure the desired metadata to propagate to the flow:
+
Note that Studio recognizes the actual metadata as the one set in `flow-1`, and the expected metadata as the one configured in `flow-2`.
+
image::custom-metadata-configure-overwrite.png[]
+
Customizing the actual and expected metadata for a referenced flow is helpful if you want to define a specific set of metadata to propagate.
