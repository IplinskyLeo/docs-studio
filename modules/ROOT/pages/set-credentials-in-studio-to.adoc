To enable Anypoint Studio to access resources in your organization, configure your Anypoint Platform credentials.


. Go to Anypoint Studio in your top navigation bar, and click *Preferences*.
. Expand Anypoint Studio in the left navigation bar, and select *Authentication*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Configure*.
. If your organization uses Anypoint Platform as the identity provider:
.. Select the *Anypoint Platform* radio button.
.. Click *OK*.
.. Enter the username and password for your Anypoint Platform user.
. If your organization uses an external identity provider:
.. Select the *External Identity* radio button.
.. Enter your organization's domain name. Consult your organization administrator if you don't know your organization's domain.
.. Select the external identity provider you want to use. 
.. Click *OK*.
.. Enter your username and password for your external identity provider.
.. Click *Sign in*.
. Click *Apply and close*.

When adding a new credential for the first time, Studio notifies you that a new master password has been created. Additionally, Studio prompts you to create two recovery questions to use in case you forget your master password. +
See xref:secure-storage.adoc[] for more information.

You can configure multiple users to authenticate in Anypoint Platform.

In every operation related to the Platform, you'll see a quick-change toolbar that allows you to change accounts and if applicable, the business group. You can also add accounts from the toolbar.

For example, if you select Search in Exchange from the Mule Palette, the toolbar displays in a slightly different form:
