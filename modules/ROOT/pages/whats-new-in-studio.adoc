= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.11 introduces support for Mule runtime engine version 4.4. It also enables you to encrypt and save your credentials using a Secure Storage facility.

== Support for Mule Runtime Engine 4.4

Mule runtime engine 4.4 is mainly focused on fixing issues, and also includes some enhancements.

* Feature Flagging. +
Mule 4.4 incorporates a feature flagging mechanism, which enables you to disable certain features that change core functionality in Mule to avoid backward compatibility issues.
* Correlation ID Management. +
Mule 4.4 enables you to modify the correlation ID associated with a Mule event. You can also change the algorithm Mule uses to generate each correlation ID.
* Improved Logging Capabilities. +
Mule 4.4 incorporates Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC), which enriches logging and improves tracking by providing more context or information in the logs for Mule events.

See xref:mule-runtime::whats-new-in-mule.adoc[] for more information.


Every time Studio starts, it checks for updates to modules in your open projects. Based on what it finds, you can choose to update to the latest minor version of your module or upgrade directly to the latest version available.

You can also manually prompt a running instance of Studio to check for module updates:

Because of the architecture of the Eclipse Secure Storage and its usage since Anypoint Studio 7.11.0, the authenticated users are now shared across all Eclipse-based workspaces and Anypoint Studio instances. See xref:secure-storage.adoc[Secure Storage] for more information.

== DataWeave Language Improvements

The 2.4 version of DataWeave introduces the following features:

* Ability to read larger-than-memory strings automatically. When you are using the indexed reader strategy and processing a String with a size larger than 1.5 MB, DataWeave automatically splits the value in chunks to avoid out-of-memory issues. Related reader properties are `com.mulesoft.dw.max_memory_allocation` and `com.mulesoft.dw.buffered_char_sequence.enabled`.
* New reader and writer properties for working with data formats. For example, the XML writer now enables you to define namespaces at the root level.
* Many new modules, functions, types, annotations, and variables. Some are experimental and subject to change in future releases.
* A number of functions are overloaded to introduce new helper functions for
handling `null` values.

Changes to the documentation include more detailed function signatures and organization of the functions by their module names, such as `dw::Core`, `dw::core::Strings`, and `dw::util::Math`.

See xref:dataweave::whats-new-in-dw.adoc[What's New in DataWeave 2.4] for more information

== Secure Storage

Anypoint Studio 7.10 and earlier versions stored the information of authenticated users in the workspace, meaning that you could have different authenticated users per workspace.

Because of the architecture of the Eclipse Secure Storage and its usage since Anypoint Studio 7.11.0, the authenticated users are now shared across all Eclipse-based workspaces and Anypoint Studio instances. See xref:secure-storage.adoc[Secure Storage] for more information.

== Flow and Subflow Referenced By

You can right-click on a flow or subflow and select the *Referenced by* option to get a list of Flow Reference components that reference your selected flow.
