= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.15.0 improves the developer experience by enhancing Studio performance for a number of users, strengthens the asset import experience, and adds more to CloudHub deployment options.

== Improved performance for customers on Windows 
Windows users now experience improved performance in Studio, as they can use the built-in tool to exclude Studio from Windows Defender scans.

== Enhanced experience importing API specifications or fragments
Studio enhances importing experience of API specifications or fragments from Design Center improving the ability to search and provide more details displaying:

* Type of asset
* Date the asset was last updated

== Easy deployment and redeployment of a Mule App to CloudHub 2.0

Users now can deploy and redeploy a Mule app to CloudHub 2.0 even if it has the same name and target as an existing one in CloudHub 2.0. This feature is helpful for redeploying a Mule app after making changes to it.

Studio and Runtime get their releases aligned by providing new features triannually.
