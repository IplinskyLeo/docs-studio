= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.14.0 introduces new features to enhance the users' experience making the daily use of Studio easier, faster, and more agile. 

== Improved Copy-Paste Experience

Users can now add a suffix to the copy-pasted Mule Palette elements and flows to avoid having similar long names.

== Deploy to CloudHub 2.0

Studio enables developers to deploy their applications to https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/saas/cloudhub-ipaas-cloud-based-integration[CloudHub 2.0^], which offers a wide variety of shared services.

== Project Creation Made Easier

The on-screen information is simplified:

* The API implementation section is now collapsable, so you can choose whether to have this section collapsed by default when you create a project.
* The API implementation tab layout is modified to get easier access to the most common options.
