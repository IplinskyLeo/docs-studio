= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.11 introduces support for Mule runtime engine version 4.4. Studio 7.11 also enables you to encrypt and save your credentials by introducing Secure Storage.


== Secure Storage

Anypoint Studio 7.10 and earlier versions stored the information of authenticated users in the workspace, meaning that you could have different authenticated users per workspace.

Because of the architecture of the Eclipse Secure Storage and its usage since Anypoint Studio 7.11.0, the authenticated users are now shared across all Eclipse-based workspaces and Anypoint Studio instances. See xref:secure-storage.adoc[Secure Storage] for more information.
