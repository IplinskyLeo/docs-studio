= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.12 introduces support for comprehensive publication of assets to Exchange and support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to Anypoint Platform.

This version also improves the metadata edition and Design Center import experiences and adds a feature to comment and uncomment objects from the canvas.

== Comprehensive Publication to Exchange

When publishing an asset to Exchange, you can now add more information such as tags, categories, name, description, and documentation to your asset directly from Studio.

== MFA Support

You can now log in to Anypoint Platform using multi-factor authentication (MFA) from Studio's built-in browser.

== Comment and Uncomment Objects from the Canvas

You can now comment and uncomment flows and components directly from the canvas:

. Right-click the flow or component that you want to comment.
. Select *Toggle Comment*.

== Improved Metadata Edition Experience

Studio 7.12 improves the overall performance of the metadata edition experience by reducing background processing and by asynchronously propagating the metadata through the Flow Reference component.


== Improved Design Center Import Experience

Studio 7.12 improves its import from Design Center experience by loading all REST APIs to import from Design Center simultaneously enabling you to search your desired API specification much faster.
