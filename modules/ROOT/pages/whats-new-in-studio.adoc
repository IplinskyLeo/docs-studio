= Whatâ€™s New in Studio

Anypoint Studio 7.14.0 introduces new features to enhance the users' experience making the daily use of Studio easier, faster, and more agile. 

== Improved Copy-Paste Experience

Now, users have the possibility to select if a suffix is added to the copy-pasted Mule Palette elements and to the flows to avoid having similar long names.

== Deploy to CloudHub 2.0

Aligned with the latest release, Studio allows developers to deploy their applications to https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/saas/cloudhub-ipaas-cloud-based-integration[CloudHub 2.0], which offers a wide variety of shared services.

== Project Creation Made Easier

The on-screen information has been simplified and now users can choose the view of API implementation when creating a project from Studio preferences:

* The API implementation section is now collapsable.
* The API implementation tab layout is modified to get easier access to the most common options.
